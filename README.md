GitHub Actions workflows often need to access a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, GCP, ... for example for resource creation or for software deployment. Therefore usually long living secrets are used and stored as secrets in GitHub. GitHub Actions OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider allows you to configure your workflow to request a short-lived access token directly from the cloud provider. By updating your workflows to use OIDC tokens, you can adopt good security practices like no cloud secrets, authentication and authorization management as well as rotating credentials.

- **Who is this for**: Developers and DevOps engineers
- **What you'll learn**: Best practice authentication for workflows against Azure 
- **What you'll build**: A workflow that uses GitHub Actions OIDC provider for authentication against Azure
- **Prerequisites**: Azure tenant with a subscription
- **How long**: This course is 2 steps long and takes less than 15 minutes to complete.

## How to start this course

1. Above these instructions, click **Use this template**, right-click **Create a new repository** and click **Open link in new tab**.
   ![Use this template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/169618716-fb17528d-f332-4fc5-a11a-eaa23562665e.png)
2. In the new tab, follow the prompts to create a new repository.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - I recommend creating a public repository—private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).

<summary><h2>Step 1: Configure OIDC in Azure</h2></summary>

_Welcome to "GitHub Actions workflow with OIDC based authentication against Azure"! :wave:_

In this step you'll configure OIDC in your Azure tenant.

**What is _Azure_**: Azure is the cloud platform of Microsoft.

**What is a _tenant_**: An Azure AD tenant is a reserved Azure AD service instance that an organization receives and owns once it signs up for a Microsoft cloud service such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365.

**What is _OIDC_**: OpenID Connect or OIDC is an identity protocol that utilizes the authorization and authentication mechanisms of OAuth 2.0.

**What is a branch?**: A [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#branch) is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named `main` and it is considered to be the definitive branch. You can create additional branches off of `main` in your repository. You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time.

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab
1. [Create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Cwindows#create-an-azure-active-directory-application-and-service-principal) by following the steps under the link
    - Assign role `Contributor` on subscription to the application
1. [Add federated credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Cwindows#add-federated-credentials) by following the steps under the link
    - `Entity type`: `Branch`
    - GitHub branch name: `deploy-resource-group`
1. [Create GitHub secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Cwindows#create-github-secrets) by following the steps under the link
1. If you are done, create a new branch with name `deploy-resource-group`

<summary><h2>Step 2: Create workflow</h2></summary>

_You did configure OIDC in Azure and created a branch! :tada:_

Configuring OIDC in Azure allows you to authenticate in a GitHub Actions workflow without the need of storing an access token in GitHub!

**What is a _workflow_**: A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create workflow

The following steps will guide you through the process of creating a GitHub Actions workflow.

1. On the **Code** tab, make sure you're on your new branch `deploy-resource-group`
1. Click on tab `Settings`
1. In section `Default branch` switch the default branch to `deploy-resource-group` (click on button <--> to switch default branch)
1. Click on tab `Actions`
1. Click on button `new workflow`
1. Choose `Simple workflow` and click `Configure`
1. Rename file to `my-first-workflow.yml`
1. Replace content of `.yml` file with the following content
```yml
name: Run Azure Login with OpenID Connect and PowerShell
on: [push]

permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
      
jobs: 
  Windows-latest:
      runs-on: windows-latest
      steps:
        - name: OIDC Login to Azure Public Cloud with AzPowershell (enableAzPSSession true)
          uses: azure/login@v1
          with:
            client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
            tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
            subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }} 
            enable-AzPSSession: true

        - name: 'Create resource group with PowerShell action'
          uses: azure/powershell@v1
          with:
             inlineScript: |
               New-AzResourceGroup -Name MyFirstResourceGroup -Location "South Central US"
             azPSVersion: "latest"
```
10. Click `Commit changes...` button
11. Wait until the GitHub Actions workflow finished and then refresh this page for the next step
